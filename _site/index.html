        <p>I am ArlenLuo, a neophyte in coding. I'm a third-year CS student in SJTU, and I just finished the exchange term in NTU. Uncertained as I am about my future, I'm eager to dive into new fields that can arise my interest, such as Machine Learning and Computer Vision. As Steve Jobs once said, stay hungry, stay foolish. Hope we can make friends with each other!</p>

        <p>嘿，朋友，你好啊！我是一只还在升级的程序猿。现就读于上海交大的计算机系，目前快大四了，正在暑研。未来有太多的不确定性，但我很愿在能激起我兴趣的新领域中一探究竟，比如机器学习和计算机视觉。正如乔布斯生前说的，求知若饥，虚心若愚。希望我们能交个朋友！</p>
